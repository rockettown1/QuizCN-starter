# QuizCN-starter
Starter project for simple iOS quiz app for CN students

The master branch is the base starter project: Basic storyboard included but no code.

There are 7 other branches which will step through the code to complete the project.

# Branches

1. connect-storyboard
Creating IBOutlets and the button Action

2. test-simplearray
Storing a few questions in an array and getting them to cycle through in the view.

3. how-about-2darray
Changing the current questions array (string array) to an array of arrays, each including a question and answer (true/false)

4. structs-instead
Creating a Question struct, then just having an array of Question objects, each with a question and an answer.

5. user-feedback
Instead of print statements in the logic (when the question is right/wrong) update the UI by changing the buttons to red or green. Involves setting up a delay. Also setting up the progressbar to display the progress through the quiz.

6. implement-mvc
Refactor to use the mvc design pattern. Pulling logic out of the viewcontroller into its own struct.

7. add-score-alert
Challenge to add a total score, and display the score on a native iOS alert.

Move to branch 7 to see the finished code.
